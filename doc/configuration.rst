Configuration
========

The DO.W.C requires a `Document Registratie Component` (short D.R.C.) where it will retrieve and update documents from and on respectively.
Please see the https://drc.utrechtproeftuin.nl/ for an example of a D.R.C. that the DO.W.C. can work with.
The D.R.C. will need to be configured in the admin of the DO.W.C. under `Services`.
