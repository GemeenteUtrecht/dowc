Configuration
=============

The DO.W.C requires a `Document Registratie Component` (short DRC) where it will retrieve and update documents from and on respectively.
Please see the https://documenten-api.vng.cloud/ for an example of a DRC that the DO.W.C. can work with.
The DRC will need to be configured in the admin of the DO.W.C. under `Services`.
